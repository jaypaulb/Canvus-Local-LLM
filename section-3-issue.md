## 3. Canvus API Integration & Real-Time Processing

This section implements the core real-time processing engine that monitors Canvus workspaces via subscription streams. We'll build the subscription management system, event processing pipeline, and integration with the existing CanvusPythonAPI. This is the foundation for all AI processing workflows and must handle concurrent processing, connection management, and event filtering.

### 3.1 Subscription Management System
- [ ] **Client Subscription**
  - Implement subscription to `/clients` endpoint
  - Create client discovery and workspace enumeration
  - Handle new client connections and workspace updates
  - Implement client disconnection handling

- [ ] **Canvas Subscription**
  - Create canvas subscription manager for each workspace
  - Implement `/canvases/{id}?subscribe` endpoint handling
  - Set up concurrent canvas monitoring
  - Handle canvas subscription stream parsing

- [ ] **Event Stream Processing**
  - Implement ASCII text stream parsing with JSON objects
  - Create keep-alive handling for connection maintenance
  - Set up event filtering for relevant widget changes
  - Implement event deduplication and race condition prevention

### 3.2 Widget Change Detection
- [ ] **Change Monitoring**
  - Monitor Title, Text, ParentID changes only
  - Implement change detection algorithms
  - Create widget state tracking
  - Set up change validation and filtering

- [ ] **Trigger Detection**
  - Implement trigger condition detection for each workflow
  - Create trigger validation and duplicate prevention
  - Set up trigger priority and queuing
  - Implement trigger timeout and cancellation

### 3.3 Event Processing Pipeline
- [ ] **Processing Queue**
  - Create async processing queue with priority levels
  - Implement concurrent processing limits (max 5 tasks)
  - Set up queue monitoring and management
  - Create queue persistence for crash recovery

- [ ] **Event Routing**
  - Implement event routing to appropriate workflow handlers
  - Create workflow selection logic based on trigger type
  - Set up event context preservation
  - Implement event logging and debugging
