## 5. Ollama Integration & Model Management

This section implements the core AI engine integration with Ollama, including model management, vision processing, and response generation. We'll build robust model validation, handle different model types, and ensure proper integration with the local Ollama instance. This is critical for all AI processing workflows and must handle model availability, performance, and error recovery.

  - Implement connection error handling and recovery

- [ ] **Model Management**
  - Implement model listing and validation
  - Create vision model capability detection
  - Set up model download and installation
  - Implement model switching and validation

- [ ] **Request Handling**
  - Create Ollama request/response models
  - Implement streaming and non-streaming requests
  - Set up request timeout and retry logic
  - Create request validation and error handling

### 5.2 Vision Model Processing
- [ ] **Image Processing**
  - Implement image file handling and validation
