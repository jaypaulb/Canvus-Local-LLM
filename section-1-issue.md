## 1. Project Setup & Foundation

This section establishes the foundational development environment, project structure, and core dependencies. We'll set up the Python environment, create the basic project structure, configure dependency management with Poetry, and establish the initial application skeleton. This phase is critical as it defines the architectural patterns and development practices that will be used throughout the project.

### 1.1 Development Environment Setup
- [x] **Create Python Virtual Environment**
  - Set up Python 3.8+ virtual environment
  - Configure Poetry for dependency management
  - Install core development dependencies (pytest, black, isort, flake8, mypy)
  - Verify Windows PowerShell compatibility

- [x] **Project Structure Creation**
  - Create `app/` directory structure
  - Set up `src/` with main application modules
  - Create `tests/` directory for test files
  - Establish `config/` directory for configuration files
  - Create `assets/` directory for icons and resources

- [x] **Configuration Files Setup**
  - Create `pyproject.toml` with Poetry configuration
  - Set up `.env` template for environment variables
  - Create `requirements.txt` for pip compatibility
  - Configure `setup.py` for distribution packaging

### 1.2 Core Dependencies Integration
- [x] **CanvusPythonAPI Integration**
  - Copy existing `lib/CanvusPythonAPI/` to `app/lib/`
  - Verify API client functionality with test server
  - Create wrapper classes for simplified integration
  - Test authentication methods (API Key vs Username/Password)

- [x] **Ollama Python Client Setup**
  - Copy existing `lib/ollama-python/` to `app/lib/`
  - Test Ollama connection and model listing
  - Verify vision model support (Gemma3 default)
  - Create model validation utilities

- [x] **System Tray Dependencies**
  - Install `infi.systray` for Windows system tray integration
  - Test system tray icon creation and menu functionality
  - Create custom icon assets for application states
  - Implement basic tray menu structure

### 1.3 Basic Application Skeleton
- [x] **Main Application Class**
  - Create `CanvusLLMInterface` class structure
  - Implement basic initialization and shutdown
  - Set up configuration loading and validation
  - Create logging infrastructure with loguru

- [x] **Configuration Management**
  - Implement `Config` class using pydantic-settings
  - Create configuration file persistence
  - Set up environment variable support
  - Implement configuration validation and defaults

- [x] **Error Handling Foundation**
  - Create custom exception classes
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Set up error logging and reporting
  - Create error recovery mechanisms
